# DialFusion

Welcome to the THE ULTIMATE DEVELOPER CHAMPIONSHIP hosted by Michael and Joseph at the Syndacate.

This is my submission for the competition. DialFusion is an autodilaer powered by t3-app stack including Next.js and Tailwind, with the twilio api. 

To start, you must copy the `.env.example` file into a new file called `.env`. Enter your necessary api keys and callback URLs. You must fill in all of these or the application will not start.

Run `npm i` (or, preferrabily, `pnpm i` in the terminal to install dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` or `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.
